This is a survey about computational usage of researchers.
We conducted 130+ interviews with researchers from Princeton and Northwestern university.
The following is the abstract to a paper that we are writing about the survey.

Computing has grown increasingly vital across diverse research disciplines,
necessitating the accommodation of researchers' varied requirements. However,
the lack of quantitative knowledge on how researchers interact with
computational resources makes it challenging to deliver appropriate support.
Prompted by a survey carried out twelve years ago, which explored the practice
of computational science within a doctoral-granting research institution, this
study revisits key questions from the prior research and expands to unexplored
areas.  By conducting comprehensive interviews with over 138 researchers at both
the original institution and another distinct one and comparing findings against
results from the prior survey, this study reveals the evolution of computational
practices, identifies emerging trends, and underscores potential areas for
future advancements.
